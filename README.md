# Project 1 - Impact of COVID-19 on Global Airport Traffic
* Utilized GeoPandas, Contextily, Folium, and Plotly to leverage geospatial data and airport traffic data to create GIS maps of how COVID has influenced global airport traffic 
* Encoded categorical variables using Label-Encoding and One-Hot-Encoding methods to create correlation heatmaps to see if there was any relationships between the variables
* Implemented data wrangling and string RegEx techniques to clean, transform and manipulate a dataset of 7247 airport traffic entries from 27 airports 
* Analyzed time series data of airport traffic to analyze the change in airport traffic during the year of 2020
